The purpose of this guide is to teach you how Stremio add-ons work and how to build one yourself. This will allow you to create contents for your favorite media center.

Although this guide is structured in steps for gradual add-on building, you can also jump to certain step just for reference, when you are building your own add-on.

## Who is this guide for

This guide is aimed mostly for developers willing to create a Stremio add-on.

We assume that you are familiar with computer programming, JSON and the HTTP protocol.

You can develop a Stremio add-on in any language you wish or even no programming language at all. The add-on may even be static data served over HTTP or IPFS.
