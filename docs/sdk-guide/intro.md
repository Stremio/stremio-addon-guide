## What is Stremio

Stremio is a modern media center that's a one-stop solution for your video entertainment. It features an add-on system that is responsible for all of the available content.

The purpose of this guide is to teach you how Stremio add-ons work and how to build one yourself, using our Add-on SDK. This will allow you to extend Stremio with your favorite content!

## Motivation

There are plenty of reasons to create your own add-on, including but not limited to:

* You want your favorite content in Stremio
* You want a fun weekend project to enhance your coding skills with
* You are running a video entertainment service and want to promote it in Stremio
* You are participating in Stremio Add-on competition

## Requirements

To build an add-on using our SDK, you only need:

* Basic programming knowledge (JavaScript)
* A recent version of NodeJS (which [you can download from their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
* An editor/IDE for JavaScript (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Video tutorials and other guides

There are also video tutorials on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_OgO2Ag911Y49ZeArzy1_w).
